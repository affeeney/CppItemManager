# C++ Portfolio: Grocery Management System

### Summary

The goal was to create a Grocery Management System in C++ that tracks and manages grocery items. The system has features like searching for items, viewing quantities, and presenting a visual representation. This project served as a solution to track and manage items on a typical grocery list.

### What I Did Well

I focused on creating structured code for the GroceryManager class. Using maps for item storage, and the implementation of functions like `loadDataFromFile()` and `saveDataToFile()` demonstrate my ability to read and write from files, and to design a well-structured codebase. 

### Areas for Improvement

While the current implementation is functional, an improvement could be achieved by separating classes and functions into their own files, promoting more organized code.

### Challenges

The most demanding aspect of the project was navigating memory management manually, requiring meticulous attention to ensure the program's stability and efficiency.

### Transferable Skills

My proficiency in the C++ language and data structures, cultivated during the development of Grocery Tracker, directly enhances my game development and software development skills. 

### Maintenance

To ensure maintainability, I used an modular approach in designing the GroceryManager class, making the code readable and adaptable.
